More than 75% of the tree species maintain their leaves all year. Canopy is never without green foliage."Forest,43,mixed_forest,natural,"areas dominated by trees generally greater than 5 meters tall, and greater than 20% of total vegetation cover. Neither deciduous nor evergreen species are greater than 75% of total tree cover."Shrubland,51,dwarf_scrub,natural,"Alaska only areas dominated by shrubs less than 20 centimeters tall with shrub canopy typically greater than 20% of total vegetation. This type is often co-associated with grasses, sedges, herbs, and non-vascular vegetation."Shrubland,52,shrub_scrub,natural,"areas dominated by shrubs; less than 5 meters tall with shrub canopy typically greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class includes true shrubs, young trees in an early successional stage or trees stunted from environmental conditions."Herbaceous,71,grassland_herbaceous,natural,"areas dominated by gramanoid or herbaceous vegetation, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation. These areas are not subject to intensive management such as tilling, but can be utilized for grazing."Herbaceous,72,sedge_herbaceous,natural,"Alaska only areas dominated by sedges and forbs, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation. This type can occur with significant other grasses or other grass like plants, and includes sedge tundra, and sedge tussock tundra."Herbaceous,73,lichens,natural,Alaska only areas dominated by fruticose or foliose lichens generally greater than 80% of total vegetation.Herbaceous,74,moss,natural,"Alaska only areas dominated by mosses, generally greater than 80% of total vegetation."Planted/Cultivated,81,pasture_hay,agricultural,"areas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures planted for livestock grazing or the production of seed or hay crops, typically on a perennial cycle. Pasture/hay vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation."Planted/Cultivated,82,cultivated_crops,agricultural,"areas used for the production of annual crops, such as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton, and also perennial woody crops such as orchards and vineyards. Crop vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of total vegetation. This class also includes all land being actively tilled."Wetlands,90,woody_wetlands,natural,areas where forest or shrubland vegetation accounts for greater than 20% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.Wetlands,95,emergent_herbaceous_wetlands,natural,Areas where perennial herbaceous vegetation accounts for greater than 80% of vegetative cover and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered with water.
