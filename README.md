# A citizen science approach to evaluating US cities for biotic homogenization
This repository contains all the data and scripts required to analyze 2016-2018 City Nature Challenge data for our paper. It is currently in review, and the preprint is available [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/27472v1/).

## Why?
Urban biodiversity can be surprisingly challenging to study because of the high variance of urban features both within and between cities, access to private property, and the constraints in collecting sufficient data to capture this diversity. One promising solution is capitalizing on the rapidly growing availability of citizen science data through the iNaturalist platform. For this project we used data collected during the annual City Nature Challenge bioblitz to investigate how urban intensification impacts biodiversity.

## The Data
All citizen science data can be accessed directly through the iNaturalist City Nature Challenge project websites, such as here: https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/city-nature-challenge-2018. We linked each observation with a land cover classification from the National Land Cover Database here: https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd2011.php. However, to save everyone a bit of time, the data we worked with can be found in the 'data' folder in this repository.

## The Analyses
All analyses can be run through the main file. The functions for the community composition and individual species patterns analyses can be found in the folder appropriately called 'functions'.
